    LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. =##<br>

1. Declare a variable 'nunNe ighbours' based on a prompt input like this:<br>

prompt("How many neighbour countries does your country<br>

2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border! (use loose equality<br>

have?');<br>

== for now)<br>

3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than I border' in case 'numNeighbours"<br>

is greater than 1<br>

4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when<br>

'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)<br>

5. Test the code with different values of 'nunNe ighbours", including 1 and 0.<br>

6. Change == to === , and test the code again, with the same values of<br>

'numNeighbours'.Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why<br>

is this happening?<br>

7. Finally, convert "nunNe ighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now<br>

when you input 1<br>

8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this<br>

situation<br>


LECTURE: Logical Operators<br>

1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way<br>

2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a<br>

country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an<br>

island<br>

3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her.<br>

You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take<br>

your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.<br>

4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: You should live in Portugal :J'. If<br>

not, log Portugal does not meet your criteria :(<br>

5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily<br>

change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in<br>

Canada :D)<br>

    // let numNeighbours = prompt("how many neighbour countries does your country have");

    // if(numNeighbours == 1){
    //     console.log("only one border")

    // }
    // else if(numNeighbours > 1){

    // ANSWER 06


    // Change == to === , and test the code again,
//     let numNeighbours = prompt("how many neighbour countries does your country have");

// if(numNeighbours === 1){
//     console.log("only one border")

// }
// else if(numNeighbours > 1){
//     console.log("more than one border")

// }
// else{
//     console.log("no border")
// }

// === THIS CONDITION IS FALSE BECAUSE THEY CHEAK BOTH (VALUE) & (TYPE)

// ANSWER 07,08

// let numNeighbours = Number(prompt("how many neighbour countries does your country have"));

// if(numNeighbours == 1){
//     console.log("only one border")

// }
// else if(numNeighbours > 1){
//     console.log("more than one border")

// }
// else{
//     console.log("no border")
// }

// ANSWER 09,10,11,12

let country = prompt("enter one country name")
let population = prompt("Enter the population range")
let speakEnglish = true;
let island = false;

if(speakEnglish && population < 50 && !island){
    console.log(`you should live in ${country}`)
}
else{
    console.log(` ${country} is not your critaria`)
}
